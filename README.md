# Playing Sounds on Gameboy Hardware

This repository gives a basic example of how to play basic sounds in GBDK 2020. It extends from our [Gameboy Joypad Input Repo](https://github.com/LaroldsJubilantJunkyard/handling-joypad-input-in-gbdk) and tutorial. (Click Here)[https://laroldsjubilantjunkyard.com/tutorials/how-to-make-a-gameboy-game/joypad-input/] for the full tutorial.

Everything is made using The [2020 GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) and the C Programming Language.

The gameboy .gb ROM file can be created by running the make.bat file. The ROM file can be ran in a emulator like [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/).
